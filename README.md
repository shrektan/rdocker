# rdocker

The R docker that I use. The plan is to have three different images:

- rdocker4ci: for continous integration, containing the core packages
- rdocker4working: for working and with some additional packages like ROracle, RSQLServer, etc.
- rdocker4server: for shiny server deploying with shiny-server built-in.

## TODO

- [x] Build the image from rocker/r-ver directly. I don't think I need the RStudio bundle in the docker image and I need a smaller image for CI.
- [x] Fix the pandoc installing issue.I bet I will encounter issues in the end because pandoc will not be installed if the image built from rocker/r-ver instead of rocker/rstudio
- [x] Add the rdocker4shiny
- [x] Add the mssqlserver odbc driver and ensure it works
- [ ] Add the oracle db driver
- [x] Add more latex packages especially those relate to CTEX.
